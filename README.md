# Storm Manager for Minecraft Server
**StormWatch** is a plugin for Bukkit/Spigot Minecraft servers that allows a dynamic, hot-pluggable API for
easily managing custom inclement weather events on any server.

This project has been built specifically for Spigot version: `1.16.5`

Documentation on the _StormWatch API_ can be found [on my personal site](https://xmit.xyz/spigot/StormWatch/manual.html).

### TODO
- [X] Chunk management and configuration on a per-storm basis.
- [ ] Command interface to enable/disable Storm types until the next reload: `/stormgr enable impact`
  - [ ] Commands for casting certain storms at target players. Thinking something like: `/stormgr cast impact SomePlayerName`

## Default Storm Types
The plugin ships with three default Storm extensions prefabricated, which can be optionally used in the configuration
file generated by the plugin.

### Shower Storms

### Streak Storms

### Impact Storms
