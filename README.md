# Storm Manager for Minecraft Server
**StormWatch** is a plugin for Bukkit/Spigot Minecraft servers that allows a dynamic, hot-pluggable API for
easily managing custom inclement weather events on any server.

This project has been built specifically for Spigot version: `1.16.5`

Documentation on the _StormWatch API_ can be found [on my personal site](https://xmit.xyz/spigot/StormWatch/manual.html).

### TODO
- [X] Chunk management and configuration on a per-storm basis.
- [ ] Command interface to enable/disable Storm types until the next reload: `/stormgr enable impact`
  - [ ] Commands for casting certain storms at target players. Thinking something like: `/stormgr cast impact SomePlayerName`
  - [ ] Should also add an option for any Storm types to have their own extra command parsing for `cast` calls; consider:
```
/stormgr cast impact SomePlayerName [opt1 opt2 ... optN]
--- Create an Impact event, instantiated for SomePlayerName
----- The rest of the options are passed to the Impact event to handle:
opt1 = DIRECT ---> Meteor spawns right over the player and rushes downward. 
opt2 = HARMLESS -> The meteor doesn't do any damage or explode.

So the full command becomes...
/stormmgr cast impact SomePlayerName DIRECT HARMLESS

All Storm types can have this extensibility built in.
```

## Default Storm Types
The plugin ships with three default Storm extensions prefabricated, which can be optionally used in the configuration
file generated by the plugin.

### Shower Storms

### Streak Storms

### Impact Storms
